<h1>Hello, Every One!</h1>
<h2>What is felixrpm?</h2>
<p>Firstly, FÃ©lix Reyes Project Manager. (Also Program and Product.)</p>
<p>Secondarily, the intriguing relationship between RPM, operational duty cycle, and human relationships at the individual-, team-, organizational-, or societal-level.</p>
<p>As a systems-thinking PM, I'm fascinated by theory informing strategy, strategy guiding operations, and operations delivering value.</p>
<p>Lastly, I like rpm in reference to analog music formats and machinery because I enjoy playing along to a spinning record every now and then.</p>
<h2>Get in touch</h2>
<p>If you want to chat about solving business problems, I'm a nice, friendly, helpful pro!</p>
